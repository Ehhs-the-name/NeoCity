    <!-- ok. the plan is to have a door you have to click on to enter the page, and that will act as the play button for the music. -->
    <!-- the door will open on hover and zoom in, like you're entering it, on click.  -->
    <!-- there will be a sign, like a home address that gives the sound disclamer. That or it'll be on the welcome mat. -->
    <!-- Sorta like the Hello Neighbour ARG site, now that I think about it -->
    <!-- All of that is to bypass google's "no autoplay" law. (FUCK THEM FOR THAT, BUT ALSO THANK YOU) -->
